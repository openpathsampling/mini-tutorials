# `initial_conditions_from_trajectories`

This tutorial shows the wide range of functionality available in the
`initial_conditions_from_trajectories` method of a `MoveScheme`. This method
performs helps create the input sample set required for any path sampling move
scheme. As this tutorial illustrates, the method can extract the required
trajectories from a wide range of inputs.

In most cases, `initial_conditions_from_trajectories` is all you need to get
prepare your trajectories for path sampling.
